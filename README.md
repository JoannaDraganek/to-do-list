## Description
Here you can see a to-do list app.
In the window that you see is "co jest do zrobienia?" there you can write your task and then added after click on "Dodaj zadanie" button.
Under the window you will see your added tasks.
When you click on green button you can mark if your task is done.
When you click on red bin button you can remove your task.
There are also two additional buttons to mark all tasks as complete and to show/hide completed tasks

## Technologies used
In the project I used the BEM convention, Immutability and ES6+ features.
